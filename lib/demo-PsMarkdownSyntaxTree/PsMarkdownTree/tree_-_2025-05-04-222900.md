            - In order to accept an applicant or candidate, all the criteria must be met, so the first one that fails will deny the applicant and send them on their way.

      - [ ] identify item type that has a _time frame_
      - [ ] identify _send_, _issue_, or _action_ (date)
        - I'm partial to "action"
        - structuring this datum is probably a bad idea
          - because proving it for most items is difficult
          - it's for this reason that date-tags were given their own table
      - [ ] identify sensitive documents, information, items
      - [ ] sensitive items need to be _redacted_ and/or _protected_
      - [ ] ``Get-...Schema``
      - [ ] note: on types of dates
        - arrival (retrieved) dates are important
        - they are useful for record-keeping and timeline of responsibility
        - they need to be accurate
        - if an arrival date cannot be determined to _a certain level of accuracy_: it must be left null
      - [ ] I need: a means of determining or recording the arrival time: either before it passes or _to the best of my knowledge_
      - [ ] task: identify dates in document: prioritize: first, date of _send_ or _action_, then, dates of _time frame_
